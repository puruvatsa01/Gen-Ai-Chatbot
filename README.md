ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project is a powerful **AI-driven chatbot** designed to help **non-technical users** in an organization easily access insights from company databases â€” just by typing their questions in natural language, in **any language**. 
The chatbot understands user intent, translates it into a valid SQL query, executes it, and returns both the **query and the results** in a clear, readable format.

Built with state-of-the-art tools like **LLaMA 2/3 (via Ollama)**, **LangChain**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, this solution bridges the gap between technical data access and everyday business users. 
It eliminates the need to know SQL or rely on data teams for every question, empowering users to get answers fast.
